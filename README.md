# Sudoku Solver using Backtracking and CSP

This project implements a Sudoku solver using Artificial Intelligence techniques.

## Algorithms Used
- Backtracking Search
- Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
- AC-3 Algorithm
- MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)
- LCV (Least Constraining Value)

## Features
- Tkinter based GUI
- Puzzle generation (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Unique solution validation
- Solver comparison
- Hint generation

## How to Run
Make sure Python is installed.
Run the file using:

python FOA_Implementation.py
